# Panels
A flexible framework for `wgpu` applications.

# Introduction
This framework lets you bring your own `wgpu` code, and skip some of the in-between setup.
There are also convienient helpers for managing the combinations of `RenderPipeline` and `BindGroupLayouts`, as well as rendering models with vertex and index buffers.

# Documentation
Coming soon...

# Credit
Some of my code is based on the [Learn Wgpu tutorial.](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/)
